# API Documentation

The `.schema.json` files in `/endpoints` and `/object-schemas` define the types for the data that different API 
endpoints return.

There are also autogenerated markdown files in [`/autogenerated-md`](./autogenerated-md/README.md) that show the schemas in a more readable format.
These are generated using `jsonschema2md` with the command:

```jsonschema2md -d ./backend/API-documentation -o ./backend/API-documentation/autogenerated-md```
